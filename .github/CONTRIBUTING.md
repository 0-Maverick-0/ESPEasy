## Issues tracker

The issue tracker is NOT a support forum.

For support questions go to our forum: https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=1

Only post an issue if you're 100% sure you've hit a bug. If your not sure, post on the forum first to see if anyone can confirm it.

This way we keep the issue tracker as short as possible, which saves our developers a lot of time.

Also there are more people on the forum that can help you with support.
